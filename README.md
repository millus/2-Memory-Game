## How do I play this game?
- Click on the cards to find all matching pairs.
- When you click on a card it flips, and you can see its symbol.
- Click on a second card to find a matching symbol.
- Only possible to look at a maximum of two cards at the same time.
- The game ends when all cards are facing up with the symbols.
- Everytime you look at two cards there is two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Cards match. (Card 1 = Card 2)
- It means: YAY! You found a match.
- What happens: The cards will stay facing up with the symbols showing.
- Next step: You got one right, now continue searching for the next pair.

### Scenario 2: Cards don't match. (Card 1 != Card 2)
- It means: Oh no, one attempt down, no match found.
- What happens: The cards will flip back with the symbols facing down.
- Next step: You didn't get this one right, but now you know what symbols these two cards have. Continue searching for next pair with this in mind.

## What does the stars mean?
- The stars is an indication on how well you did!
- Use as few attempts as possible when trying to reveal all pairs.
- If you have too many attempts where you don't find a match, you will lose stars.
- You start with 3 stars, try to keep all of them till the end.

TODO: write about the time aspect as well in the readme.
